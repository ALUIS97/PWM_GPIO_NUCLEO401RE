# PWM_GPIO_NUCLEO401RE


This repository shows how to make a PWM with the GPIOs, the function delay, and how to use EXTI interrupts to increment or decrement the TIME  of the high state of a PWM with STM32 NUCLEO BOARD 401RE. It also has an electronic diagram and a report of the cubeMX generation. All the source code was made with STM32CUBE IDE AND CUBEMX.
